# FizzBuzz kata
## Rules ([Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/))
 * You can only write production code if there is a failing test
 * You can only write test if there is no failing test (compilation or assertion)
 * You can only write production code to make a test passed

### Stage 1
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

### Stage 2
 * A number is `Fizz` if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 * A number is `Buzz` if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
