# FizzBuzz kata
## TDD ([UncleBob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd))
 * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
 * You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
 * You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## Rules ([Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/))
### Stage 1
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

### Stage 2
 * A number is `Fizz` if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 * A number is `Buzz` if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
